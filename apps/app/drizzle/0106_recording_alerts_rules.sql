-- =============================================================================
-- Retell call alerts: a stated rule at destruction, the purge and closure
-- (CI-SEAMS, 21 October 2026).
--
-- 0105 added retell_recording_alerts, a tenant table with a clinic_id, and
-- said "DELETE stays for a clinic's destruction", but nothing deleted it
-- there: destroyClinicData never reached it, app_mark_clinic_destroyed()
-- did not check it, and no closed-account trigger froze it. A destruction
-- would have been recorded complete with the clinic's call ids still here,
-- and the catalog tests (tests/booking-request-destruction.test.ts,
-- tests/retention.test.ts, tests/account-closure.test.ts) failed on it.
--
-- The rule, the conservative one: every row of the clinic goes at its
-- destruction (lib/offboarding/offboarding.ts, destroyClinicData, before
-- this check); a resolved alert goes thirty days after it was resolved, by
-- the nightly purge (RECORDING_ALERT_RESOLVED_RETENTION_DAYS,
-- lib/retention/purge.ts); an open one is never purged, since it is the
-- only sign that Retell still holds a call. A person's erasure leaves it:
-- it names no one, and the open alert is how the erasure's own Retell step
-- gets done (lib/patient-rights/erasure.ts, ERASURE_VENDOR_STEPS).
--
-- Below: 0098's app_mark_clinic_destroyed with the table added to the rows
-- destruction must have deleted, and the table frozen once the account is
-- closed, as every other table destruction empties (drizzle/0096).
